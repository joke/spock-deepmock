`spock-deepmock` adds deep mocking capabilities to the http://spockframework.org/[Spock Framework].

In contrast to builtin http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3/all_in_one.html#_mocking[mocks]
a deep mock will return another deep mock object automatically. This way there
is no need to define chains of nested mocks.

* Adds `DeepMock()` and `GroovyDeepMock()` for deep mocking
* Build deep mocking chains for nested objects
* Uses same syntax as the builtins `Mock()` and `GroovyMock()`
* Supports interaction verification
* Works with Spock Framework 1.3 and 2.0

== Usage

Deep mocks can be defined as any other mock. Features like options are supported.

.Define deep mocks
[source,groovy]
----
def mock = DeepMock(Nested)
Nested mock = DeepMock()

def mock = DeepMock(name: 'customName')
Nested mock = DeepMock(name: 'customName')
----

.CallerTest.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
def 'calling nested mock'() {
    setup:
    Nested mock = DeepMock()
    def caller = new Caller(mock)

    when:
    // calls mock.getChild().getChild().getName()
    def res = caller.nameOfSubSubChild()

    then:
    1 * mock.child.child.name >> 'Hello'

    expect:
    res == 'Hello'
}
